# TypeScript and Next.js Code Quality Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for maintaining high-quality, readable, and maintainable code in TypeScript and Next.js applications. These guidelines are designed to improve code consistency, reduce bugs, and enhance team collaboration.

## Linting Standards

### ESLint Configuration
- Use `@typescript-eslint` rules for TypeScript-specific linting
- Enable strict mode with:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,
      "strictNullChecks": true,
      "strictFunctionTypes": true
    }
  }
  ```
- Configure ESLint to enforce consistent code style

### Recommended Rules
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` - Prevent unused variables and imports
- `@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type` - Require explicit return types for functions
- `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports` - Enforce consistent import styles
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` - Ensure React hooks dependencies are complete

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Framework
The project uses **Jest + React Testing Library** for testing components and utilities.

### Test Requirements
- **New functions/classes** → New test functions
- **Changed behavior** → Updated/new tests

### Test Structure
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
- Group related tests in suites with meaningful descriptions

### Example Structure
```typescript
describe('User Service', () => {
  describe('getUserById', () => {
    it('should return user when valid ID is provided', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      
      // Act
      const result = await userService.getUserById(userId);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(result.id).toBe(userId);
    });
  });
});
```

### Coverage Requirements
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage across components and services
- Focus on business logic rather than trivial code paths
- Test edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values

## React Best Practices

### Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Keep components small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props

### State Management
- Use React's built-in state management (`useState`, `useReducer`)
- For complex state, consider context API or dedicated libraries like Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback`

### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components using dynamic imports
- Use React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting
- Optimize rendering by avoiding inline functions in render methods

## Readability Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `getUserData`
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces: `UserService`, `UserInterface`
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`

### Code Organization
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Break complex logic into smaller, reusable functions
- Group related components in the same directory or file when appropriate

### Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to public APIs:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Fetches user data from the API
   * @param userId - The unique identifier for the user
   * @returns Promise resolving to User object
   */
  async function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {
    // Implementation
  }
  ```

### Code Formatting
- Use Prettier with consistent configuration:
  ```json
  {
    "semi": true,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "trailingComma": "es5"
  }
  ```
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces for TypeScript/JavaScript)

## Component Architecture

### Next.js Specific Guidelines
- Use Server Components when possible for better performance
- Implement proper error boundaries with `error.tsx` and `loading.tsx`
- Leverage Next.js built-in features like:
  - Image optimization (`next/image`)
  - Dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`)
  - API routes (`app/api/...`)

### Component Structure
```
components/
├── ui/
│   ├── button/
│   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   └── button.module.css
│   └── input/
│       ├── Input.tsx
│       └── input.module.css
└── layout/
    └── header/
        ├── Header.tsx
        └── header.module.css
```

## Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Use `next/bundle-analyzer` to monitor bundle sizes
- Implement code splitting with dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Minimize external dependencies that aren't essential

### Rendering Strategies
- Choose appropriate rendering strategy:
  - Server Components (SSR)
  - Client Components (CSR)
  - Static Site Generation (SSG)
  - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use libraries like `zod` for schema validation
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### Authentication & Authorization
- Follow OAuth2.0 patterns for external authentication
- Implement role-based access control where appropriate
- Secure cookies with proper flags (HttpOnly, SameSite)

## Code Quality Metrics

### Maintainability Index
- Keep cyclomatic complexity under 10 per function
- Limit class size to no more than 50 lines of code
- Avoid deeply nested conditional statements (>3 levels)

### Performance Indicators
- Page load time: < 3 seconds (90th percentile)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 2 seconds
- Time To Interactive (TTI): < 5 seconds

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Are variable names descriptive and consistent?
- [ ] Is the code properly formatted with Prettier?
- [ ] Do all functions have appropriate return types?
- [ ] Are error boundaries implemented correctly?
- [ ] Does the component follow Next.js best practices?
- [ ] Are there any unused imports or variables?
- [ ] Is documentation provided for public APIs?

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Automated Tooling
- **ESLint**: Configured with TypeScript rules and React hooks plugin for catching common issues
- **Prettier**: Enforced formatting to maintain consistent code style across the team
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Type checking ensures type safety at compile time

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Configure pre-commit hooks using Husky or similar tooling
- Run ESLint, Prettier, and tests before allowing commits
- Prevent committing code that violates quality standards

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- All pull requests must pass:
  - Linting checks with ESLint
  - Code formatting validation with Prettier
  - Unit/integration tests
  - Type checking with TypeScript compiler
- CI pipeline should fail if any quality rule is violated

### Code Review Process
- All code changes require at least one peer review
- Reviews must verify:
  - Compliance with the code quality guidelines in this document
  - Proper test coverage for new/changed functionality
  - Adherence to React best practices and component architecture patterns
- Automated checks run as part of the PR process

### Testing Enforcement
- All new functions/classes must include corresponding tests
- Changed behavior requires updated or new tests
- Test coverage is monitored with tools like Jest's coverage reporter
- Integration tests are required for critical business logic flows

## Continuous Integration

### Linting
- Run ESLint checks on every commit
- Configure pre-commit hooks to prevent linting errors

### Testing Requirements
All new and changed code must have tests:
- New functions/classes → New test functions
- Changed behavior → Updated/new tests
