# Narrative and Interaction Tests - Quest Weaver Game Engine

## Overview

This document tracks the development and testing of advanced narrative interactions and natural language processing features for the Quest Weaver game engine. Inspired by classic adventure games like King's Quest and Space Quest, we aim to create a robust system that handles creative, unexpected player interactions while being more user-friendly than 80s counterparts.

## Goals

### Natural Language Processing Enhancements
- **Stemming**: Handle word variations (take/taking/took, open/opening/opened)
- **Stop Word Removal**: Filter out "I", "want", "to", "can", "the", etc.
- **Synonym Recognition**: "take" = "get" = "pick up" = "grab"
- **Flexible Input**: Support various phrasings for the same action
- **Context Understanding**: Better interpretation of player intent

### Interaction Complexity
- **Multi-step Interactions**: Actions that require sequences
- **Conditional Logic**: Actions that depend on game state
- **Creative Solutions**: Unexpected but logical approaches
- **Failure Handling**: Helpful error messages instead of "I don't understand"

### Narrative Testing
- **Short Narratives**: 3-5 action sequences
- **Medium Narratives**: 10-15 action complex scenarios  
- **Long Narratives**: 20+ action adventure sequences
- **Branching Stories**: Multiple paths and outcomes

## Test Categories

### 1. Classic Adventure Game Scenarios
Testing interactions inspired by Sierra and LucasArts games:
- Using unexpected items in creative ways
- Combining objects in non-obvious manners
- Environmental interactions with multiple objects
- Puzzle-solving through item manipulation

### 2. Natural Language Variations
Testing different ways players might express the same intent:
- Formal: "I would like to take the lamp"
- Casual: "grab lamp"
- Question: "can I pick up the lamp?"
- Complex: "put the lamp in my bag"

### 3. Edge Cases and Wacky Interactions
- Trying to use items in impossible ways
- Attempting actions with missing prerequisites
- Creative interpretations of player commands
- Handling ambiguous or unclear inputs

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Basic NLP Enhancement
- [ ] Implement word stemming system
- [ ] Create stop word filtering
- [ ] Build synonym dictionary
- [ ] Enhance command parser flexibility

### Phase 2: Complex Interaction Testing
- [ ] Create challenging interaction scenarios
- [ ] Test multi-object interactions
- [ ] Implement conditional action logic
- [ ] Add context-aware responses

### Phase 3: Narrative Integration
- [ ] Design short narrative tests
- [ ] Create medium-length adventure scenarios  
- [ ] Build comprehensive long-form narratives
- [ ] Test branching story mechanics
